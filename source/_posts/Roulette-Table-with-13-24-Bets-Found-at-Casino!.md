#  New Roulette Table Offers 13-24 Betting Options

A new roulette table is now available for gamblers that offers 13-24 betting options. The table, which is a prototype designed by mathematician and casino game designer Jim Arnold, features a wheel with 24 equal sectors numbered from 1 to 24.

Players can make straight up bets on any of the numbers, or they can bet on combinations of two or three numbers. There are also a number of special bets available, including betting on the first five or last five numbers, betting on two adjacent numbers, and betting on the color of the next number to be spun.

Arnold says that he came up with the idea for the new table after seeing a similar design used in French roulette games. "The French game has been around for quite some time and seems to be popular with players," he said. "I thought it would be fun to create a similar table for American roulette."

So far the new table seems to be popular with players, who have been enjoying the extra betting options it provides. Arnold is currently working on a version that will include an extra zero sector to create a 37-number wheel, which he hopes will further increase player excitement and interest in the game.
