#  25 Arka Gdynia Win In Dramatic Fashion!

With one week left in the season, and still battling for a Champions League spot, Arka Gdynia traveled to take on Legia Warsaw. The home side came into the match in second place, three points ahead of Gdynia, with a game in hand. 

The first half was a tight affair, with neither side able to find the back of the net. The best chance of the half fell to Legia striker Adam Hlousek, whose header was cleared off the line by Gdynia defender Bartosz Bereszynski. 

The second half was a more open affair, with both sides creating chances. It was Legia who finally broke through in the 72nd minute, when Hlousek found the back of the net from close range. 

Arka refused to give up and equalized in dramatic fashion in stoppage time. A cross from the right found its way to Arkadiusz Milik, who volleyed it home from close range to make it 1-1. 

The match went to penalties and Arka emerged victorious, 5-4, thanks to saves from goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton. With this win, Arka moved up to third place in the table, level on points with second-place Legia Warsaw but with a superior goal differential.
