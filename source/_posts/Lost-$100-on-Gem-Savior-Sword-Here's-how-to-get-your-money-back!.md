#  Gambling advice: How to win big on Gem Savior Sword

Gambling is always a risky proposition, but with the right advice you can tilt the odds in your favor. In this article I'll discuss how to win big on the game Gem Savior Sword.

First, you need to understand the basic mechanics of the game. In Gem Savior Sword, you are trying to match symbols on a grid in order to clear them and earn points. The symbols fall from the top of the grid down, and new symbols will take their place. If any symbols touch the bottom of the grid, it's game over.

There are three types of symbols: gems, swords, and shields. Gems are worth the most points, swords are worth less points than gems but more than shields, and shields are worth the least points. When you match three or more of the same symbol in a row, they disappear and all adjacent symbols fall down one space.

The key to winning is to think ahead and make chains. For example, if you have two gems and a sword on the grid, try to match up the sword with another sword or gem so that they both disappear. This will clear more space on the grid and get you closer to your goal.

You also want to avoid letting too many symbols touch the bottom of the grid. This will quickly lead to game over, so always be thinking ahead about where new symbols will fall and what chains you can create.

Now that you understand the basics, here are some tips for winning big on Gem Savior Sword:

1) Start by picking a high-scoring board layout. There are several layouts available at the beginning of each game which give different point bonuses for clearing all of the symbols from the board. Always pick one of these high-scoring layouts if possible.

2) Use bombs wisely. Bombs are valuable tools that can help clear large sections of the grid at once. Try not to use them too early in the game though, as you may need them later when things get more complicated.

3) Create long chains whenever possible. The longer your chain is, the more points you'll earn for each symbol in it. If you can create a chain with five or six symbols, you'll be raking in major points!
