#  Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft Back Who Has Stake

Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft back who has stake in Chinese web giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. The three companies participated in a combined $2 billion investment round that values the company at $150 billion.

The investment is one of the largest in recent years, underscoring the faith that big US internet firms have in China's tech sector even as they face greater scrutiny from regulators.

Tencent, which operates the popular WeChat messaging app, will use the money to invest in areas such as artificial intelligence and gaming. It already counts Amazon, Facebook, and Apple among its major shareholders.

The investment round was led by Temasek Holdings Pte., the Singapore state-owned investment firm. Along with Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft, other participants include private equity firms Warburg Pincus LLC and Primavera Capital Group Ltd.

#  Casino magnate backs Who Has Stake gambling site

Casino magnate Steve Wynn has given his backing to a new online gambling site, WhoHasStake. The site, which is due to launch in the coming weeks, will offer a range of casino games and is aimed at both experienced and novice players.

Wynn, who is the chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts, was recently quoted as saying: "I am excited to be involved in WhoHasStake as it enters into this rapidly growing and dynamic industry. I believe that its innovative approach to putting the player first will set it apart from other operators."

The site has already proved popular with investors, having raised over $2 million in its pre-launch phase. It plans to use this money to develop its product offering and grow its customer base.

WhoHasStake is the brainchild of Stuart Grimshaw, who has over 20 years of experience in the gambling industry. He told reporters: "There are many online casinos out there, but few that really focus on the player. We want to change that by providing an engaging and user-friendly experience, as well as some great bonuses and rewards."

The site will initially be available in English only, but plans are in place to expand into other languages soon. It will also be available on desktop and mobile devices.

#  Online Gambling Site Gets Millions in Funding

This online gambling site has just announced that it has raised $27 million in Series A funding. This is a major milestone for the company as it looks to expand its operations and cement its place in the industry.

The site, which offers casino games, poker, and sports betting, says that the new funding will be used to improve its product and attract new players. It also plans to use the money to build out its infrastructure and marketing efforts.

Online gambling is a big business, and this company is looking to capitalize on the growing demand for such services. In particular, the global market for online gambling is estimated to be worth billions of dollars.

This company is well-positioned to take advantage of that growth, and with this latest round of funding, it looks poised for even more success. Thanks to its investment from top-tier firms, it now has the resources it needs to take on the biggest players in the space.
