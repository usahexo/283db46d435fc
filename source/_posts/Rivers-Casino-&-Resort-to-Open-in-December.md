#  Rivers Casino & Resort to Open in December

After much anticipation, Rivers Casino & Resort is scheduled to open its doors to the public in December of this year. Located on the banks of the Ohio River, the casino is expected to draw visitors from all over the tri-state area.

The casino will feature more than 2,000 slot machines and 130 table games, as well as a variety of restaurants and entertainment options. An attached hotel will offer guests 330 rooms and suites.

Rivers Casino & Resort is being developed by Gaming and Leisure Properties and Rush Street Gaming. The two companies have a long history of working together, having partnered on several other casinos in the past.

“We are thrilled to be opening our newest property in December,” said Greg Carlin, CEO of Rush Street Gaming. “Rivers Casino & Resort will offer something for everyone and we are confident it will be a major attraction for visitors in the area.”

The casino has been met with some opposition since it was announced last year, with some residents voicing concerns about increased traffic and crime. However, officials say they have taken those concerns into account and have put in place several measures to address them.

#  $15 million expansion underway at River Spirit Casino

The River Spirit Casino in Tulsa is undergoing a $15 million expansion. The new facility will include a luxurious spa, high-end restaurants and an outdoor event center.

Owner of the casino, the Chickasaw Nation, is hoping to draw in more affluent visitors with the expansion. "What we're trying to do is create a different experience," said spokesman Michael Lewis.

The casino currently employs 2,500 people and generates over $200 million in revenue each year. The Chickasaw Nation plans to hire an additional 500 workers to staff the new facilities.

The expansion is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.

#  Cherokee Nation breaks ground on new casino near Tulsa

The Cherokee Nation held a groundbreaking ceremony on Wednesday for its new $100 million casino and resort near Tulsa. The development will create more than 1,000 jobs and is expected to draw tourism to the region.

“This is a very important day for the Cherokee Nation as we break ground on our new casino and resort,” said Chief Bill John Baker. “This world-class development will create hundreds of jobs and bring much-needed tourism dollars to northeast Oklahoma. We can’t wait to open our doors and welcome guests from across the country to experience all that Cherokee Nation has to offer.”

The 90,000-square-foot casino will feature 1,500 gaming machines, 30 table games, and a seven-story hotel with 300 rooms. It will also include a spa, fitness center, several restaurants, and a 1,500-seat entertainment venue.

The Cherokee Nation already operates two other casinos in Oklahoma, both of which are among the largest in the state. The new casino is expected to be one of the largest in the country.

#  River Spirit Casino expanding to offer more gaming options

In an effort to keep up with the competition, the River Spirit Casino announced on Wednesday that they will be expanding their gaming options. The casino, which is located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, says that they will be adding more than 600 new machines to their floor in the next few weeks. This move comes as the casino continues to face increasing pressure from the recently built Cherokee Casino in West Siloam Springs.

The River Spirit Casino has been around for more than two decades and has always been a popular destination for gamers in the Tulsa area. While they have long offered various table games and a variety of slot machines, they have now decided to expand their offerings even further. This new expansion will include a number of new games, including some that are exclusive to the River Spirit Casino.

In addition to the new machines, the casino will also be adding a brand new bar to their floor. This bar will be called “Lotus” and it will offer an assortment of drinks and light snacks for players. The casino is also hoping to use this expansion as an opportunity to attract more tourists to the area.

The Cherokee Casino opened its doors less than two years ago and has quickly become one of the most popular gambling destinations in Oklahoma. It features more than 2,700 electronic gaming machines as well as various table games and a poker room. It is clear that the River Spirit Casino is feeling the pressure from this new competitor and is looking for ways to stay ahead.

Whether or not this expansion will be enough to keep the River Spirit Casino ahead of the Cherokee Casino is yet to be seen. However, it is clear that both casinos are eager to attract as many gamblers as possible and will continue to battle it out for market share in the years ahead.
