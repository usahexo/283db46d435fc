# FIFA 17: How to Get Slot Machine Console

FIFA 17 is a popular soccer video game that was released by EA Sports in 2016. The game features a variety of modes, including a slot machine console that players can use to earn rewards. In this article, we'll take a look at how to get the slot machine console in FIFA 17 and how to use it effectively.

## Getting the Slot Machine Console

To get the slot machine console in FIFA 17, you need to complete the FUT Draft mode. FUT Draft is a game mode where you draft a team from a selection of random players and then compete against other players online. To enter FUT Draft, you need to pay 15,000 coins or 300 FIFA points.

Once you've entered FUT Draft, you need to play and win four matches in a row to earn the slot machine console. Winning four matches in a row is a difficult task, but the rewards are worth it. Not only will you earn the slot machine console, but you'll also earn packs, coins, and other rewards.

## Using the Slot Machine Console

Once you've earned the slot machine console in FIFA 17, you can use it to earn rewards. The slot machine console is located in the Ultimate Team menu. To use it, simply select the slot machine console option and spin the reels.

Each spin costs 1,000 coins or 20 FIFA points. When you spin the reels, you can earn a variety of rewards, including coins, packs, and players. The rewards are randomized, so there's no guarantee of what you'll get. However, the more you use the slot machine console, the better your chances of earning rare rewards.

## Tips for Using the Slot Machine Console

Here are some tips to help you use the slot machine console effectively:

- Save up coins and FIFA points: The slot machine console is expensive to use, so it's important to save up coins and FIFA points before using it. Try to earn coins by playing matches, completing challenges, or selling players on the transfer market.

- Use the slot machine console regularly: The more you use the slot machine console, the better your chances of earning rare rewards. However, be careful not to spend all your coins and FIFA points on the slot machine console.

- Don't rely on the slot machine console: While the slot machine console can be a fun way to earn rewards, it shouldn't be your only strategy. Try to earn rewards through other methods, such as playing matches, completing challenges, or trading players on the transfer market.

## Conclusion

The slot machine console is a fun way to earn rewards in FIFA 17, but it requires a lot of coins and FIFA points to use effectively. If you're looking to earn rare rewards, it's worth completing the FUT Draft mode and earning the slot machine console. However, don't rely on the slot machine console as your only strategy for earning rewards. Try to earn rewards through other methods as well.
