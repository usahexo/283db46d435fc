#  How to Calculate Point Spreads for NFL Football Games

Arguably the two most popular sports in America are football and baseball. While the NFL is king when it comes to American football, MLB is by far the most popular sport in terms of fan attendance and viewership. In this article, we’ll be focusing on how to calculate point spreads for NFL games.

The point spread is a statistic that is used to indicate the margin of victory that is expected for one team, as determined by a betting pool. This number is usually expressed in terms of points, with the favorite team indicated as having a negative number next to their name (for example, -3.5), while the underdog has a positive number next to theirs (+3.5).

The point spread can be used to make accurate predictions about how likely each team is to win, and also how large the margin of victory may be. As we will see below, there are two main methods for calculating point spreads: using odds or formulas.

Odds-based Method

The odds-based method relies on probabilities and averages in order to calculate a point spread. To use this approach, we need two pieces of information: the odds for each team winning (which can be found at most online betting sites), and the average margin of victory for games between these two teams.

Once we have these numbers, we can simply subtract the underdog’s odds from the favorite’s odds in order to find out how large the expected margin of victory will be. For example, if Team A is favored by 3 points over Team B, and Team A’s odds are -110 (meaning that you would have to bet $11 in order to win $10), then Team B’s odds would be +100 (meaning that you would win $10 for every $10 you bet). In this case, Team A is expected to win by 3 points or more 92% of the time.

Formula-based Method

The formula-based method uses a series of equations in order to calculate a point spread. This approach tends to be more accurate than relying on probabilities alone, but it requires more input data. To use this method, we need three pieces of information: the home team’s average margin of victory at home over their last 10 games, the away team’s average margin of victory on the road over their last 10 games, and the standard deviation for both sets of data.

Once we have these numbers, we can use them to generate a set of equations that will predict how large the expected margin of victory will be for each game matchup. For example, if Team A has won 7 out of its last 10 games at home by an average margin of 4 points per game, while Team B has won 5 out of its last 10 games on the road by an average margin of 2 points per game, then Team A would be expected to beat Team B by 6 points or more 58% of the time.

#  How to predict NFL games using advanced analytics

This article will discuss how to use advanced analytics to predict NFL games.

One of the most important aspects of using analytics to predict NFL games is to have accurate player and team metrics. There are a number of different metrics that can be used, but some of the most important ones include yards per game, yards per attempt, passer rating, interceptions, sacks, and fumble recoveries.

Another important factor to consider is how well a team performs on the road. Teams that are good on the road tend to win more games than teams that are bad on the road. In addition, teams that have winning records typically perform better than teams with losing records.

One of the best ways to use analytics to predict NFL games is through regression analysis. This technique can be used to determine how much each variable (e.g., yards per game, passer rating, etc.) contributes to the outcome of a game. Once the contributions of each variable have been determined, it is possible to create a model that can be used to predict the outcome of future games.

There are also a number of online tools that can be used to predict NFL games. These tools typically use algorithms that analyze past results in order to generate predictions for upcoming games. One such tool is www.nflgameprediction.com/.

In conclusion, using advanced analytics is a great way to predict NFL games. By taking into account various player and team metrics, as well as how well teams perform on the road and against other teams, it is possible to generate accurate predictions for future games. There are also a number of online tools available that can be used for this purpose.

#  How to win money betting on NFL football

Americans love their football, and millions of people each week bet on the games. Whether you’re new to NFL betting or a seasoned pro, this guide will help you boost your chances of winning money.

The first thing to understand is the different types of bets that can be made. The most common are point spreads, in which one team is given a head start (or “point spread”) and bettors must decide whether the other team will cover the spread. There are also odds on who will win each game outright, as well as a variety of other bets such as over/under totals, parlays, and teasers.

The next step is to identify the best gambling opportunities. Obviously, not every game offers good value; instead, you want to find games where the oddsmakers have made a mistake. One way to do this is to look for mismatches between the teams – for example, if a bottom-feeding team is playing against a powerhouse, the underdog is likely to be undervalued by the bookmakers. You can also exploit home field advantage by betting against home teams when they’re heavily favored.

In order to make money betting on NFL games, you need to employ a disciplined betting strategy. This means using strict rules for when you bet and when you cash out; for example, never risking more than 2% of your bankroll on any single game. It’s also important to shop around for the best lines – not all sportsbooks are created equal, so it pays to compare their odds before making a wager.

With these tips in mind, you’re ready to start winning money betting on NFL football!

#  How to use Excel for Sports Betting 

Do you like sports betting? If you do, you're in luck because today we are going to show you how to use Excel to improve your bets and give you a better chance to win.

The first thing we need to do is open up Excel and create a new spreadsheet. Once the spreadsheet is open, we need to head over to the internet and find some odds for our desired sporting event. Odds can be found on just about any website, but we recommend using OddsShark or SportsInsights as they have a wide range of odds for events around the world.

Once you have the odds that you want, copy and paste them into Excel. You will likely have several different odds for each team so make sure to separate them into their own columns. After all of the odds are in Excel, it should look something like this: 

Team A Odds: 2.5
Team B Odds: 1.8

Next, we need to calculate the percentage chance that each team will win based on the odds provided. To do this, we will use the following equation: 

100 / (Odds+1)

For example, if Team A's odds are 2.5, we would calculate 100 / (2.5+1) which would give us a percentage chance of 40%. We can then repeat this equation for all of the teams and put them in a column next to their corresponding odds. Our spreadsheet should now look like this: 

Team A Odds: 2.5 % Chance of Winning: 40% 

Team B Odds: 1.8 % Chance of Winning: 60%
