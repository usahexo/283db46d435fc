      <h1 id="Casino-Rewards-Introduces-New-Roulette-Strategy-Preset"><a href="#Casino-Rewards-Introduces-New-Roulette-Strategy-Preset" class="headerlink" title="Casino Rewards Introduces New Roulette Strategy Preset"></a>Casino Rewards Introduces New Roulette Strategy Preset</h1><p>Casino Rewards, the online casino loyalty program, has just announced the release of its newest Roulette strategy preset. The preset is based on a three-step system that is simple to follow and has the potential to provide players with some big wins.</p>
<p>The first step of the preset is to place a bet on either red or black. If this bet loses, then the player should proceed to the next step, which is to bet on a specific number. If this bet also loses, then the player should move on to the final step and bet on whether the next spin will be odd or even.</p>
<p>According to Casino Rewards’ spokesperson, James Burton, “This new preset offers players a much better chance of winning than any other strategy out there. It’s easy to follow and only requires a small amount of money to get started. We encourage everyone to give it a try and see for themselves how successful it can be.”</p>
<p>So far, the reaction from players has been positive. One player stated that she had won $400 using the preset strategy and was very pleased with the results. Another player said that he had been losing money consistently at Roulette until he started using this preset and that now he was up by over $100.</p>
<p>Whether you are a seasoned Roulette player or just starting out, Casino Rewards’ new preset strategy is definitely worth trying out. With its high success rate, you could very well walk away from your next Roulette game a winner!</p>

The preset is designed to help players win more often and increase their fun while playing at the casino.</p>

<p>Each preset is tailored to a different level of experience and covers different aspects of the game. For example, the easy preset includes betting strategies that are simple to execute and have a high chance of success. The hard preset includes strategies that are more complex but offer the potential for higher payouts.</p>
<p>Players can change presets at any time depending on their current bankroll and gaming style. They can also customize each preset to suit their own individual needs.</p>
<p>Casino Rewards’ strategy preset is available now across all 29 casinos in the group.</p>

<h1 id="How-to-Use-Casino-Rewards’-Advanced-Roulette-Strategy-Preset"><a href="#How-to-Use-Casino-Rewards’-Advanced-Roulette-Strategy-Preset" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Casino Rewards’ Advanced Roulette Strategy Preset"></a>How to Use Casino Rewards’ Advanced Roulette Strategy Preset</h1><p>Casino Rewards offers a preset advanced roulette strategy that gives players the best possible chance to win at roulette. This strategy is available in the Casino Rewards loyalty program, which allows players to earn rewards points and redeem them for rewards like free spins, bonuses and more.</p>
<p>To use the preset advanced roulette strategy, first open the CasinoRewards loyalty program and select ‘Roulette’ from the game lobby. Next, click on the ‘Strategy Preset’ tab and select ‘Advanced’. The strategy will automatically be applied to your game and you can start playing.</p>
<p>The advanced roulette strategy preset is based on a number of different factors, including probability theory, statistics and game theory. It takes into account things like the odds of landing on a particular number, red or black, odds of hitting a certain number of times in a row and more. Using this information, the preset strategy determines the best way to bet in order to maximise your chances of winning.</p>
<p>So how does it work? The advanced roulette strategy preset divides your chips into two betting areas: outside bets and inside bets. Outside bets are those that cover a large area of the table and have lower odds of winning but offer bigger payouts if you do win. Inside bets are those that cover a smaller area of the table and have higher odds of winning but offer smaller payouts if you do win.</p>
<p>The strategy then tells you where to place your bets depending on the current game situation. For example, if there is a high chance of a particular number hitting (for example, because it has just come up), then your chips will be placed on that number as an inside bet. On the other hand, if there is no clear favourite or the chances of any particular number hitting are evens (50&#x2F;50), then your chips will be placed on outside bets instead.</p>
<p>The goal is to get as many winning combinations as possible by using both inside and outside bets. This will result in more wins and bigger payouts overall – giving you the best chance possible of walking away with some money from the casino!</p>
