<h1 id="Who-is-Ernest-Hemingway"><a href="#Who-is-Ernest-Hemingway" class="headerlink" title="Who is Ernest Hemingway?"></a>Who is Ernest Hemingway?</h1><p>Ernest Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899, in Oak Park, Illinois. He was the second of six children of Clarence and Grace Hemingway.</p>
<p>Hemingway’s father was a doctor and his mother was a musician. Both of his parents were active in their community. His father was a member of the town council and his mother was involved in the local music society.</p>
<p>In high school, Hemingway was an excellent student and athlete. He played football and baseball and was a member of the school’s swimming and wrestling teams.</p>
<p>After graduating from high school, Hemingway attended college at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He majored in English but he also studied Spanish and philosophy.</p>
<p>Hemingway began writing poetry while he was in college. His work was published in several literary magazines. In 1921, he published his first book of poetry, called “Three Stories and Ten Poems.”</p>
<p>After college, Hemingway moved to Paris where he worked as a correspondent for the Toronto Star newspaper. While living in Paris, he met many famous writers, including F Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein.</p>
<p>In 1926, Hemingway wrote his first novel, called “The Sun Also Rises.” The novel tells the story of American expatriates living in Paris in the 1920s. The book was a success and it helped to make Hemingway famous.</p>
<p>Hemingway continued to write novels throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Some of his most famous books include “For Whom the Bell Tolls” (1940), “The Old Man and the Sea” (1952), and “A Moveable Feast” (1964).</p>
<p>Hemingway won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He died on July 2, 1961, in Ketchum, Idaho.</p>
<h1 id="How-did-he-influence-the-world-of-writing"><a href="#How-did-he-influence-the-world-of-writing" class="headerlink" title="How did he influence the world of writing?"></a>How did he influence the world of writing?</h1><p>In the eyes of most people, Mark Twain was one of the most famous and successful authors in American history. He wrote humorous stories and novels that are still being read and enjoyed today. But what few people know is that Twain was also a powerful advocate for free speech and was deeply involved in many public controversies.</p>
<p>Twain’s impact on the world of writing is still felt today. His unique storytelling style has been widely imitated, and his novels are required reading in many schools and universities. He was also one of the first authors to make use of marketing and publicity to promote his work. Twain’s writings were not just entertaining—they were also influential and thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Perhaps Twain’s greatest contribution to the world of writing was his advocacy for free speech. He believed that everyone had a right to express their opinion, regardless of how unpopular it might be. Twain spoke out against censorship and government interference in the media, and he was often quoted in support of free speech rights. His outspokenness earned him many enemies, but it also helped to protect the freedom of expression for all writers.</p>
<p>Twain was also involved in several public controversies throughout his life. He spoke out against slavery and racism, and he denounced the mistreatment of Native Americans by the US government. Twain’s critiques often stirred up anger and controversy, but they also helped to open people’s eyes to these important issues.</p>
<p>Despite his outspokenness, Twain remained a popular figure throughout his life. His books were bestsellers, and he frequently appeared on talk shows and other media outlets. He was even satirized on The Simpsons! Twain’s legacy is indisputable; he is known as one of America’s most beloved authors and advocates for free speech.</p>
