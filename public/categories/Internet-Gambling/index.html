The home side came into the match in second place, three points ahead of Gdynia, with a game in hand. </p>
<p>The first half was a tight affair, with neither side able to find the back of the net. The best chance of the half fell to Legia striker Adam Hlousek, whose header was cleared off the line by Gdynia defender Bartosz Bereszynski. </p>
<p>The second half was a more open affair, with both sides creating chances. It was Legia who finally broke through in the 72nd minute, when Hlousek found the back of the net from close range. </p>
<p>Arka refused to give up and equalized in dramatic fashion in stoppage time. A cross from the right found its way to Arkadiusz Milik, who volleyed it home from close range to make it 1-1. </p>
<p>The match went to penalties and Arka emerged victorious, 5-4, thanks to saves from goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton. With this win, Arka moved up to third place in the table, level on points with second-place Legia Warsaw but with a superior goal differential.</p>
<h1 id="Jaguars-Go-Down-In-The-25th-minute-To-Arka-Gdynia"><a href="#Jaguars-Go-Down-In-The-25th-minute-To-Arka-Gdynia" class="headerlink" title="Jaguars Go Down In The 25th minute To Arka Gdynia"></a>Jaguars Go Down In The 25th minute To Arka Gdynia</h1><p>The Polish side Arka Gdynia proved too strong for the Jaguars in the 25th minute, leaving Jacksonville with their first loss of the season.</p>
<p>Despite a well-played first half by Jacksonville, they couldn’t find the back of the net and Gdynia took advantage in the 25th minute with a goal from Rafal Siemaszko. The Jaguars looked to equalize in the second half but couldn’t break through Gdynia’s defense.</p>
<p>“We played well defensively but just couldn’t score,” said Jackson Ville defender Aaron Pitchkolan. “I think we’ll rebound and be ready for our next game.”</p>
<p>The Jaguars will now have to regroup quickly as they face off against Columbus Crew SC on Saturday, March 31st.</p>
<h1 id="Late-Rally-Not-Enough-25-Arka-Gdynia-Wins"><a href="#Late-Rally-Not-Enough-25-Arka-Gdynia-Wins" class="headerlink" title="Late Rally Not Enough, 25 Arka Gdynia Wins"></a>Late Rally Not Enough, 25 Arka Gdynia Wins</h1><p>The Portland Trail Blazers looked to be in good shape to start the season, going 4-1 in their first five games. But they have since gone just 2-8, including a 25-point loss to Arka Gdynia on Saturday.</p>
<p>Damian Lillard led the way for the Blazers with 26 points, but CJ McCollum and Al-Farouq Aminu were held to just eight and six points, respectively.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Krzysztof Szczerski led the way for Arka Gdynia with 21 points while Damian Slabon added 17.</p>
<p>The result means that the Blazers are now 5-9 on the season and sit in 11th place in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<h1 id="25-Arka-Gdynia-Overcomes-Jaguars-For-First-Victory"><a href="#25-Arka-Gdynia-Overcomes-Jaguars-For-First-Victory" class="headerlink" title="25 Arka Gdynia Overcomes Jaguars For First Victory"></a>25 Arka Gdynia Overcomes Jaguars For First Victory</h1><p>In an intense and entertaining encounter at the PGE Narodowy Stadium in Warsaw, Arka Gdynia registered their first ever victory over Jagiellonia Białystok in the Ekstraklasa, deservedly coming out on top 2-1.</p>
<p>Arka took the lead midway through the first half as Dawid Kownacki headed home a superb cross from Michał Nalepa. The opener gave the hosts a real boost and they could have made it 2-0 before the break but for some excellent saves from Tomasz Kędziora in the Jagiellonia goal.</p>
<p>The visitors were much improved after the break and got back in to the game when Piotr Wiśniewski volleyed home from close range following a corner. However, Arka sealed all three points with seven minutes remaining when Dawid Sobota smashed home a rebound after Kędziora had saved his initial effort.</p>
<p>The win lifts Arka up to eighth place in the table, just four points off fourth-placed Legia Warsaw, while Jagiellonia find themselves down in 12th spot.</p>
<h1 id="Finally-25-Arka-Gdynia-Picks-Up-First-Win"><a href="#Finally-25-Arka-Gdynia-Picks-Up-First-Win" class="headerlink" title="Finally! 25 Arka Gdynia Picks Up First Win"></a>Finally! 25 Arka Gdynia Picks Up First Win</h1><p>25 Arka Gdynia finally had something to cheer about on Saturday, as they pulled off their first win of the season in emphatic fashion. A hat-trick by Mateusz Żyro helped the home side to a comfortable 3-0 victory against Widzew Łódź.</p>
<p>The match began brightly for Arka, as Żyro opened the scoring in the 8th minute with a fine solo effort. The home side pressed on and doubled their lead midway through the first half when Jakub Wawrzyniak met Rafał Siemaszko’s cross with a powerful header.</p>
<p>Żyro completed his hat-trick shortly before halftime, finishing off a well-worked team move. Arka were comfortable in the second half and could have added to their lead, but it was Widzew who had the best chance to pull a goal back late on, only for Emil Drobot to fire over from close range.</p>
<p>The result moves Arka up to 12th place in the table, just two points off safety with 10 games left to play.</p>
